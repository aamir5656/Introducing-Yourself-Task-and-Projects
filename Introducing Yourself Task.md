# Internship Introducing Yourself

Hi everyone! My name is Aamir Shahzad. I am currently learning Data Science and trying to improve myself step by step. I focus on learning through practical work because it helps me understand concepts more clearly. I enjoy exploring datasets, finding useful patterns, solving problems, and building models that can be applied in real situations. Over time, I have developed a strong interest in how data can support decision-making and improve business performance.

## Practical Projects I Have Completed

### 1. Social Media Performance Analysis
Analyzed engagement trends and performance metrics to understand what type of content works best. I worked on identifying which posts get more attention, and how user engagement varies over time. This helped me learn how to interpret data and draw actionable insights.

### 2. Resume Screening Automation
Built an NLP-based automation approach to classify resumes and extract important skills. This project taught me how to preprocess text data and use machine learning models for practical automation tasks.

### 3. Churn Prediction Model
Created a machine learning model to identify customers who are likely to leave a service. I learned how to work with labeled datasets, apply feature engineering, and evaluate models to make reliable predictions.

### 4. Competitor Benchmarking Dashboard
Designed an interactive dashboard to compare brand performance using multiple KPIs. This project helped me gain experience in data visualization and presenting insights in a clear and understandable way.

### 5. A/B Testing for Website Optimization
Performed test analysis to measure which version of a website performs better and improves conversions. I learned how to analyze experiment data and make decisions based on statistical results.
